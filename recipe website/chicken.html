        1. -Add the coconut oil in to a large saucepan and heat the oil over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, ginger to the heated oil and cook until softened. <br>

          <i>  2 – 3 tbsp coconut oil,½ onion,4 garlic cloves,1 inch ginger </i>
             <br>
             <br>
        2. -Add curry powder, chili powder/cayenne pepper, paprika, cinnamon, curry leaves and mix to combine. Cook for a few minutes until you start to smell the spices. <br>

           <i> 6 – 7 curry leaves or 2 bay leaves,2 ½ tbsp roasted Sri Lankan curry powder,1 cinnamon stick,1 tsp cayenne pepper,1 tbsp paprika </i>
            <br>
            <br>
        3. -Add the chicken, serrano peppers/green chili peppers, salt, 3 roma tomatoes, 1 tsp sugar, and mix to coat. Cook for 10 minutes with the lid off, on medium high heat. Stir frequently to make sure the chicken or the spices don’t burn. <br>

          <i>  ½ tsp salt,2 lbs chicken,,2 serrano peppers (or regular green chili),3 roma tomatoes,2 tsp brown sugar</i>
             <br>
             <br>
        4. -Add coconut milk, water, vinegar, and bring the curry to a boil. If you want less gravy, add less liquid. <br>

          <i>  ½ cup coconut milk,½ cup water,2 tsp apple cider vinegar </i>
            <br>
            <br>
        5. -Lower the heat, and let it simmer with the lid closed, for 15 – 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with salt to taste. The chicken should be completely cooked by this point. Taste the curry and season to taste if needed.
             <br>
             <br>
        6. -If the chicken curry gravy is too thin, or there's too much of it, uncover and simmer the curry for a further 10 minutes or longer. This step is optional, but it will allow the water to evaporate and the gravy to thicken.
             <br>
             <br>
        7. -Turn off the heat and let the chicken cool down slightly. Serve with rice or roti.

    <h2>HOW TO SERVE THIS CHICKEN CURRY</h2>
    <p>
        We serve it with rice and some vegetable side dishes. My favorite is beetroot curry!
         I always loved chicken curry and beetroot curry together. I highly recommend that combination 
         of sweet beetroot curry with the spicy chicken curry.
        
        Another option is to serve it with roti. Sri Lankans love and prefer to eat Pol roti, 
        which is a flat bread made with coconut and wheat flour. But we also love godhambara roti (or roti canai / roti paratha), 
        and maybe even some naan bread if we have some at home</p>
