          <p class="makep">
            1. -Take the boneless chicken and cut it into large pieces. Rinse them well and add cinnamon, 
            cardamom, turmeric powder, and salt. Mix everything well and place it on the stove.
               <br>
                <br>
            2. -Cook covered under high flame till the chicken turns to tender. For me, it takes about 12 minutes.
             In a halfway through, or after 6 minutes take off the lid and give a good stir. You don’t need to add water,
              but if you feel the chicken starts to burn before it cooks well, you need to add some water.
            <br>
            <br>
            3. -Let the chicken cool down before handling. Now tear the chicken into small pieces.
            <br>
            <br>
            4. -Heat the oil in a deep fry pan and fry the chicken pieces under high flame. Fry them till it turns
             into little brown. For me, it takes about 5 minutes.
            <br>
            <br>
            5. -Dice the onion, green chilies, garlic cloves, and curry leaves.
            <br>
            <br>
            6. -Also, dice the potatoes.
            <br>
            <br>

            7. -Get ready with chili powder, mustard seeds, salt, and water.
            <br>
            <br>
            8. -Heat the oil and add the mustard seeds. Let it splutter. Now add half of the onion and keep the rest aside for final preparation. 
            Fry the onion under medium flame till it turns into translucent. For me, it takes about 2 minutes.
            <br>
            <br>
            9. -Add garlic, curry leaves, and green chilies. Mix and fry them under medium flame until the onion start turns to brown color.
            <br>
            <br>
            10. -Now add potato, chili powder, and salt. Also, add the water and mix them well.
            <br>
            <br>
            11. -Cook covered under low flame until all the water disappears. For me, it takes about 5 minutes.
            <br>
            <br>
            12. -Now add the fried chicken pieces and rest of the onion.
            <br>
            <br>
            13. -Mix and cook uncovered under low flame for 1 or 2 minutes. Stir and mix constantly to avoid burn.
            <br>
            <br>
            14. -Taste the curry and adjust salt if needed.
            <br>
            <br>

            15. -Now take the spring roll paper and cut them into three symmetric pieces. If you use 20 spring roll papers, 
            you will get 60 sheets after cut them into symmetric pieces. I used two sheets for each samosa. Hence, I made 30 samosas.
            <br>
            <br>

            16. -Make the samosas.
            <br>
            <br>
            17. -Heat the oil in a deep fry pan and add samosas. Fry them until the outer layer gets light brown color. Let the
             cooking oil gets maximum heat before place the samosas in it.
            <br>
            <br>
            18. -This is the tastiest way to make chicken samosa recipe. Serve and enjoy this Sri Lankan style crispy chicken samosa.
