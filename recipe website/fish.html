            Marinating the fish :
            <br>
            <br>
1. -Cut the fish into 2 – 3 inch pieces (this doesn’t have to precise). <br>
<i>450 – 500 g swordfish or tuna</i>
<br>
<br>

2. -Place the fish in a bowl, along with all the other marinade spices. <br>
 Mix to coat and let the fish marinate for 10 – 20 minutes.<br>
<i>1 tsp sea salt,¼ tsp turmeric powder,1 tsp Sri Lankan curry powder,½ tsp ground black pepper,½ tsp cayenne pepper</i>
<br>
<br>
3. -While the fish is marinating, prep and start to cook the curry.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Making the curry :
<br>
<br>
4. -Heat about 1 – 2 tbsp of oil in a medium to large size pot, over medium heat.<br> 
<i>Preferably use vegetable oil, canola oil, or coconut oil.</i>
<br>
<br>
5. -When the oil has heated, add the onion, and saute until it starts to soften. Then add the garlic and ginger, and saute until the onion has further softened.<br>
<i>½ medium onion,2 – 3 cloves garlic,1 inch piece of ginger</i>
<br>
<br>
6. -Add the curry leaves, green chili, turmeric, curry powder, cardamom, cumin, black pepper, cayenne pepper and cinnamon. 
<br>
<br>

7. -Saute for about 30 – 60 seconds until the spices become fragrant, but take care not to let them burn.<br>

<i></i>
<br>

8. -Add the fish and tamarind, and gently mix until the fish is coated with all the spices.<br>

<br>

9. -Add the coconut milk and stir it in.<br>
<i>2 cups coconut milk</i>
<br>
<br>
10. -Bring the curry to a boil over medium high / high heat. Then lower the heat to a gentle simmer,
 and simmer the curry without the lid for about 20 minutes or until the fish is cooked through.
 <br>
 <br>
11. -Taste and add more salt and/or tamarind to taste.<br>
<i>Salt to taste</i>
<br>
<br>
12. -Let the curry sit for at least another 10 – 20 minutes if you can, before serving. <br>
This allows the flavors to develop further. Leftovers taste even better!
Serve the fish curry with rice or roti, and other curries or side dishes.
