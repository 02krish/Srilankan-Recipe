          1. -Clean the potatoes and place them in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring the water to a boil 
          and cook the potatoes until they are tender. Remove the potatoes from the water and remove the skin when they are cool to handle.
          2. -Crush them with a fork (doesn’t have to be smooth, little chunks are okay) and set aside.
          3. -With a fork, flake or break the fish into small pieces. Just like the potatoes, some chunks are okay,
           since they will get crushed when they are being cooked.
          4. -In a saucepan, heat the 3 tbsp of oil over medium heat.
          5. -Add the onion, ginger and garlic and saute until the onions become tender and translucent.
          6. -Add the green chilli peppers, salt, sugar and spices and saute for about a minute. Add the fish and 
          cook while mixing the spices through the fish for about 10-15 minutes.
          7. -Add the 2 tbsp lemon juice and tomato sauce and mix it through.
          8. -Add the potatoes and mix it through the fish until well combined. Taste and add salt (to taste) and the 
          remaining tablespoon of lemon juice if needed. Set the fish mix aside and let it cool.
          9. -When it has cooled down, take a spoonful of the mix and roll it into a smooth 1 1/2 inch diameter ball.
           Leave these balls on a parchment paper lined baking tray.
          10. -In a bowl, mix the two eggs and on a separate plate, mix the bread crumbs with the optional spices.
          11. -Evenly coat each fish ball with the egg mix and then coat them with the bread crumbs. Make sure to evenly coat
           the fish balls with breadcrumbs. Take care to not cause any cracks. If there is a crack you can re-dip in the egg wash 
           and re-coat with breadcrumbs.
          12. -In a saucepan heat enough oil to deep fry the cutlets to about 350°F/180°C.
          13. -When the oil is hot enough, fry the cutlets until they turn a dark golden brown – about a minute.
          You can fry a few cutlets at a time in the oil without overcrowding the pan.
          14. -Place the fried cutlets on a paper towel to drain the excess oil. You can keep the cutlets in a warm oven to 
          keep them warm and crispy until you are ready to serve.
          15. -Serve with tomato sauce or chilli sauce as a snack. Or as a side dish for a rice and curry meal.
