    ▢⅛ cup hot water<br>
    ▢3 -4 cardamom pod seeds crushed just over ¼ tsp<br>
    ▢¼ tsp of nutmeg (If using fresh nutmeg, use less as it will be more potent)<br>
    ▢2 cups of thick coconut milk (First press milk) if the coconut milk is lumpy – 
    which can happen in cold weather – warm it up to dissolve the lumps <br>

        <p class="makep">
            1. -Preheat oven to 320°F / 160°C
            <br>
            <br>
            2. -Oil and prepare 7-8, ½ cup capacity ramekins.
            <br>
            <br>
            3. -In a large bowl combine the sugar and water and stir until 
            it becomes a paste with no lumps (the sugar does not need to dissolve completely)
            <br>
            <br>
            4. -Add the eggs and egg yolk, spices and salt and whisk until
             well combined – i.e. till the egg mixture becomes very slightly thick 
             (not the “ribbony stage,” just enough to thoroughly mix the sugar and eggs).
              Take care not to make the egg mixture frothy.
            <br>
            <br>
            5. -Add the 2 cups of coconut milk and whisk well.
            <br>
            <br>
            5. -Pour the mix into the prepared ramekins (or a large dish if you prefer). Cover the ramekins / dish with foil.
            <br>
            <br> 
            7. -Bake the ramekins/dish in a water bath for about 30 – 40 minutes for the ramekins and up to an hour if in a large dish,
             depending on the depth of it. You want the custard to set, but the middle to be very slightly wobbly.
            <br>
            <br>
            8. -Remove from the oven and let them cool for about 15 minutes in the water bath.
            <br>
            <br>
            9. -When cool enough to handle, remove them from the water bath and cover the ramekins with plastic wrap,
             and place it in the fridge to chill for at least 3 hours (longer for larger dishes). Best chilled overnight.
            <br>
            <br>
            10. -Serve as is, or with some cashew nuts on top.
