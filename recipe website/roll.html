1. -Add oil to a pan. Then add onion and garlic. When they’re soft add carrots
 and cook for about a minute until carrots are tender. Now add chili flakes and some salt,
  mix, add potatoes, and tuna to the mix. Mash and mix everything together using a spoon.
   Add leek and black pepper at the end. Mix and cook for about a minute. Adjust salt. Let the mixture cool
<br>
<br>
2. -Whisk flour, milk, and water together to form a smooth batter. There should be no lumps in the batter. 
You can use a blender to mix this too
<br>
<br>
3. -Heat a small nonstick pan. Pour the batter using a large spoon or a ladle and swirl the pan in a circular
 motion so the batter can spread throughout the pan evenly. Pancake has to be very thin so don’t put too much batter.
  Cover and cook for about a minute until it’s cooked but still flexible. Do not make it crispy. Pancakes should look 
  like thin crepes. ** Keep the leftover pancake batter for breading
<br>
<br>
4. -Put the pancake on a plate. Put about 3 tbs of filling and fold three side edges to the middle and roll it over 
to make a cylindrical shape roll. Please refer to the images here.
<br>
<br>
5. -Dip a roll in the batter, lift and let the excess batter fall back in and then place in the breadcrumbs. 
Use tongs for easy handling. Cover well with breadcrumbs. Put on a clean dry plate. Do this to one roll at a time.
 ** if you don't have any leftover batter from the pancakes, quickly mix some flour water and salt to make a thick batter.
  Or you can also use whisked eggs
<br>
<br>
6. -Heat oil in a deep fryer or in a frying pan. When the oil is hot, fry rolls until they are golden brown.
